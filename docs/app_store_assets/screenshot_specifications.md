2. **Clarity:** Ensure all text is legible and important UI elements are clearly visible.

3. **Content:** Use realistic, high-quality content that accurately represents the app's functionality.

4. **Localization:** Prepare for localization by keeping text overlays separate from the base screenshots.

5. **Branding:** Include app branding elements and maintain color scheme consistency.

6. **Device Frames:** Use appropriate device frames that match the target platform (iOS or Android).

7. **Text Overlays:** Keep text concise, benefit-focused, and positioned consistently.

## Production Process

1. **Setup Test Environment:**
   - Ensure the app is running the latest production build
   - Configure test accounts with appropriate content and progress
   - Set up devices or emulators with correct resolutions

2. **Capture Raw Screenshots:**
   - Navigate to each feature
   - Ensure optimal content display
   - Capture screenshots at required resolutions

3. **Post-Processing:**
   - Add device frames appropriate to each platform
   - Add text overlays with feature titles and descriptions
   - Apply consistent branding elements
   - Verify text legibility and visual appeal

4. **Review and Approval:**

   - Organize files according to platform requirements
   - Prepare localized versions if needed

## File Naming Convention

Use the following naming convention for screenshot files:

```
[platform]_[feature]_[device]_[orientation].[format]
```

Examples:
- `ios_dashboard_iphone13promax_portrait.png`
- `android_lab_environment_pixel6_landscape.png`

## Localization Considerations

For each language supported by the app, we will need to:
1. Create separate text overlays in each language
2. Ensure UI elements in screenshots display in the correct language
3. Verify text length and positioning works across all languages
