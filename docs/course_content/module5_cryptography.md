## 5.1 Fundamentals of Cryptography

### Core Concepts

Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversaries. Modern cryptography intersects disciplines including mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering. The core concepts include:

- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring information is accessible only to authorized parties
- **Integrity**: Maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of users or systems
- **Non-repudiation**: Preventing the denial of previous commitments or actions

### Historical Context

The evolution of cryptography spans thousands of years:

1. **Classical Cryptography** (Pre-20th Century)
   - Substitution ciphers (Caesar cipher, Vigenère cipher)
   - Transposition ciphers
   - Limited by manual encryption/decryption

2. **Mechanical Era** (Early-Mid 20th Century)
   - Enigma machine (WWII)
   - Mechanical cipher devices
   - First electromechanical encryption systems

3. **Modern Cryptography** (Late 20th Century-Present)
   - Computer-based encryption
   - Mathematical foundations
   - Public key cryptography
   - Quantum cryptography

### Cryptographic Primitives

The building blocks of cryptographic systems include:

- **Encryption Algorithms**: Transform plaintext into ciphertext
- **Key Management**: Generation, exchange, storage, and replacement of keys
- **Random Number Generation**: Creating unpredictable values for cryptographic operations
- **Hash Functions**: One-way functions that map data to fixed-size values
- **Digital Signatures**: Authenticate the identity of a sender and integrity of data

## 5.2 Symmetric Encryption

### Principles of Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption:

- **Advantages**: Fast, efficient for large data volumes
- **Disadvantages**: Key distribution challenges, scalability issues
- **Key Length**: Directly relates to security strength

### Block Ciphers

Block ciphers process fixed-size blocks of data:

1. **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**
   - Developed in the 1970s
   - 56-bit key (considered insecure today)
   - Block size of 64 bits

2. **Triple DES (3DES)**
   - Applies DES three times with different keys
   - Effective key length of 112 or 168 bits
   - Slower than modern alternatives

3. **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**
   - Current standard for symmetric encryption
   - Key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits
   - Block size of 128 bits
   - Efficient in both hardware and software implementations

### Stream Ciphers

Stream ciphers encrypt data one bit or byte at a time:

1. **RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4)**
   - Once widely used in protocols like WEP and SSL
   - Now considered insecure for most applications
   - Variable key length

2. **ChaCha20**
   - Modern stream cipher
   - Used in TLS and other protocols
   - 256-bit key, 64-bit nonce

### Block Cipher Modes of Operation

Modes determine how block ciphers process data larger than a single block:

1. **Electronic Codebook (ECB)**
   - Simplest mode, each block encrypted independently
   - Not recommended for most applications due to pattern preservation

2. **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)**
   - Each block XORed with previous ciphertext before encryption
   - Requires initialization vector (IV)

3. **Counter Mode (CTR)**
   - Converts block cipher into stream cipher
   - Encrypts counter values, then XORs with plaintext
   - Parallelizable and efficient

4. **Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)**
   - Combines CTR mode with authentication
   - Provides both confidentiality and integrity
   - Widely used in TLS and other protocols

## 5.3 Asymmetric Encryption

### Principles of Asymmetric Encryption

Asymmetric (or public key) cryptography uses different keys for encryption and decryption:

- **Public Key**: Distributed openly, used for encryption
- **Private Key**: Kept secret, used for decryption
- **Advantages**: Solves key distribution problem, enables digital signatures
- **Disadvantages**: Slower than symmetric encryption, requires larger keys

### RSA Algorithm

The most widely used asymmetric algorithm:

1. **Key Generation**
   - Generate two large prime numbers (p and q)
   - Compute n = p × q
   - Compute φ(n) = (p-1) × (q-1)
   - Choose e such that 1 < e < φ(n) and gcd(e, φ(n)) = 1
   - Compute d such that (d × e) mod φ(n) = 1
   - Public key: (n, e), Private key: (n, d)

2. **Encryption**
   - Ciphertext = (Plaintext^e) mod n

3. **Decryption**
   - Plaintext = (Ciphertext^d) mod n

4. **Security**
   - Based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers
   - Recommended key length: 2048 bits or greater

### Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

A modern approach offering equivalent security with smaller keys:

1. **Principles**
   - Based on algebraic structure of elliptic curves over finite fields
   - Relies on the difficulty of the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem

2. **Advantages**
   - Smaller key sizes (256-bit ECC ≈ 3072-bit RSA)
   - Lower computational requirements
   - Efficient for mobile and IoT devices

3. **Applications**
   - TLS/SSL
   - Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
   - Secure messaging apps

### Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange

A method for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel:

1. **Protocol Steps**
   - Alice and Bob agree on public parameters (prime p and generator g)
   - Alice chooses secret a, sends A = g^a mod p to Bob
   - Bob chooses secret b, sends B = g^b mod p to Alice
   - Both compute shared secret: K = B^a mod p = A^b mod p = g^(ab) mod p

2. **Security**
   - Based on the difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem
   - Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks without authentication

## 5.4 Hash Functions and Data Integrity

### Principles of Cryptographic Hash Functions

Hash functions convert data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size output:

- **Properties**
  - One-way (preimage resistance)
  - Collision resistance
  - Avalanche effect (small input changes cause significant output changes)
  - Deterministic (same input always produces same output)

### Common Hash Algorithms

1. **MD5**
   - 128-bit output
   - Now considered cryptographically broken
   - Still used for non-security applications (checksums)

2. **SHA-1**
   - 160-bit output
   - Deprecated for security applications since 2011
   - Collision attacks demonstrated

3. **SHA-2 Family**
   - Includes SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512
   - Widely used in current applications
   - No practical attacks known

4. **SHA-3**
   - Newest member of the Secure Hash Algorithm family
   - Based on the Keccak algorithm
   - Designed with different internal structure than SHA-2

### Message Authentication Codes (MACs)

MACs provide both integrity and authentication:

1. **HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)**
   - Combines hash function with a secret key
   - Used in IPsec, TLS, and other protocols
   - Formula: HMAC(K, m) = H((K ⊕ opad) || H((K ⊕ ipad) || m))

2. **CMAC (Cipher-based Message Authentication Code)**
   - Based on block cipher rather than hash function
   - Used for authenticating data in constrained environments

## 5.5 Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)

### Digital Certificates

Digital certificates bind public keys to entities:

1. **X.509 Standard**
   - Defines certificate format
   - Contains subject, issuer, validity period, public key, signature

2. **Certificate Authorities (CAs)**
   - Trusted third parties that issue certificates
   - Verify identity before issuing
   - Maintain certificate revocation lists (CRLs)

3. **Certificate Chain of Trust**
   - Root CA → Intermediate CA(s) → End-entity certificate
   - Trust anchored in root certificates

### Certificate Validation

The process of verifying a certificate's authenticity:

1. **Signature Verification**
   - Verify the CA's digital signature on the certificate

2. **Validity Period Check**
   - Ensure certificate is not expired

3. **Revocation Check**
   - Check CRL or use Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)

4. **Chain Validation**
   - Verify each certificate in the chain up to a trusted root

## 5.6 Cryptographic Protocols

### Transport Layer Security (TLS)

The primary protocol for securing web communications:

1. **TLS Handshake**
   - Negotiate protocol version and cipher suite
   - Authenticate server (and optionally client)
   - Establish shared secret using key exchange
   - Derive session keys

2. **TLS Record Protocol**
   - Encrypts and authenticates application data
   - Provides fragmentation, compression, and MAC

3. **TLS 1.3 Improvements**
   - Reduced handshake latency (1-RTT, 0-RTT)
   - Removed obsolete and insecure features
   - Forward secrecy by default

### Secure Shell (SSH)

Protocol for secure remote login and other secure network services:

1. **Key Components**
   - Server authentication
   - Client authentication (password or public key)
   - Encrypted communication channel
   - Data integrity verification
