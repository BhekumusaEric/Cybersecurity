## 4.1 Web Application Architecture

### Modern Web Application Components

Modern web applications typically consist of multiple components:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (often using frameworks like React, Angular, Vue)
- **Backend**: Server-side code (Node.js, Python, PHP, Java, etc.)
- **APIs**: RESTful or GraphQL interfaces for data exchange
- **Databases**: SQL or NoSQL data stores
- **Authentication Systems**: User identity management
- **Third-party Services**: Payment processors, analytics, content delivery networks
- **Microservices**: Distributed application components

### Security Implications of Web Architecture

Each component introduces specific security considerations:

1. **Client-Side Security**
   - Browser security model (Same-Origin Policy, CORS)
   - JavaScript security issues
   - Local storage and session storage risks
   - Client-side validation limitations

2. **Server-Side Security**
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Server configuration hardening
   - Dependency management
   - Error handling and logging

3. **API Security**

   - Access control
   - Encryption of sensitive data
   - Backup and recovery

## 4.2 OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) maintains a list of the most critical web application security risks. The current Top 10 (as of 2021) includes:

### 1. Broken Access Control

Restrictions on authenticated users are not properly enforced, allowing attackers to:
- Access unauthorized functionality
- View sensitive data
- Modify data belonging to other users
- Escalate privileges

**Example Attack Scenarios:**
- Modifying URL parameters to access another user's account
- Accessing admin functionality without proper authorization
- Bypassing access controls through API endpoints

**Detection Methods:**
- Manual testing of access controls
- Code review for authorization checks
- Automated scanning for missing access controls

**Prevention Strategies:**
- Implement deny-by-default access control model
- Enforce record ownership
- Disable directory listing
- Implement proper session management
- Use API authorization mechanisms

### 2. Cryptographic Failures

Failures related to cryptography that often lead to sensitive data exposure:
- Insufficient encryption of sensitive data
- Use of weak cryptographic algorithms
- Improper certificate validation
- Hardcoded cryptographic keys

**Example Attack Scenarios:**
- Accessing unencrypted data in transit using packet sniffing
- Decrypting weakly encrypted data
- Exploiting insecure direct object references to access sensitive files

**Detection Methods:**
- Network traffic analysis
- Configuration review
- Code review for cryptographic implementations

**Prevention Strategies:**
- Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Use strong, up-to-date algorithms and protocols
- Properly manage and protect cryptographic keys
- Disable caching for sensitive data
- Verify independently the effectiveness of configurations

### 3. Injection

User-supplied data is not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the application:
- SQL injection
- NoSQL injection
- OS command injection
- LDAP injection
- Expression Language injection

**Example Attack Scenarios:**
- Modifying SQL queries through user input
- Injecting commands into unvalidated form fields
- Exploiting template injection vulnerabilities

**Detection Methods:**
- Source code review
- Automated scanning
- Manual penetration testing

**Prevention Strategies:**
- Use parameterized queries
- Input validation and sanitization
- Escape special characters
- Use ORM frameworks
- Implement least privilege principle

### 4. Insecure Design

Flaws in the design and architectural security controls:
- Missing or ineffective security controls
- Insecure business flows
- Lack of threat modeling during design

**Example Attack Scenarios:**
- Business logic flaws allowing price manipulation
- Insufficient rate limiting enabling enumeration attacks
- Lack of security requirements leading to vulnerable features

**Detection Methods:**
- Threat modeling
- Security architecture review
- Scenario-based testing

**Prevention Strategies:**
- Implement secure development lifecycle
- Use secure design patterns and frameworks
- Conduct threat modeling
- Integrate security requirements into user stories
- Establish secure defaults

### 5. Security Misconfiguration

Improper configuration of application, frameworks, application server, or platform:
- Unnecessary features enabled

- Error handling revealing stack traces
- Outdated software
- Insecure default settings

**Example Attack Scenarios:**
- Accessing default administration interfaces
- Directory listing providing information about application structure
- Unpatched flaws in server software

**Detection Methods:**
- Configuration review
- Vulnerability scanning
- Penetration testing

**Prevention Strategies:**
- Implement secure deployment process

- Review and update configurations
- Segmented application architecture
- Security headers implementation

### 6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components

Using components with known vulnerabilities:

- Automated attacks targeting known vulnerabilities
- Compromising servers through vulnerable applications

**Detection Methods:**
- Software composition analysis
- Dependency checking
- Vulnerability scanning

**Prevention Strategies:**
- Remove unused dependencies
- Continuously inventory components and their versions
- Monitor for vulnerabilities in components
- Obtain components from official sources
- Plan for component end-of-life

### 7. Identification and Authentication Failures

Confirmation of the user's identity, authentication, and session management:
- Weak passwords allowed
- Credential stuffing
- Session fixation
- Improper session timeout
- Missing multi-factor authentication

**Example Attack Scenarios:**
- Password spraying attacks

- Properly implemented session management
- Rate limiting and CAPTCHA

### 8. Software and Data Integrity Failures

Code and data integrity failures:
- Insecure CI/CD pipelines
- Unsigned code or updates
- Untrusted CDNs
- Unverified dependencies

**Example Attack Scenarios:**

- Ensure segregation of environments

### 9. Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

Insufficient logging, detection, monitoring, and response:
- Auditable events not logged
- Logs not monitored for suspicious activity
- Logs only stored locally
- Inadequate alerting thresholds
- Lack of incident response plans

**Example Attack Scenarios:**
- Attackers exploiting systems without detection
- Malware remaining undetected on systems
- Attacks against multiple accounts without triggering alerts

**Detection Methods:**
- Log review
- Monitoring system assessment
- Incident response testing

**Prevention Strategies:**
- Implement effective monitoring and alerting
- Establish log management with appropriate retention
- Ensure high-value transactions have audit trails
- Establish incident response and recovery plans
- Implement a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system

### 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Web applications fetch remote resources without validating user-supplied URLs:
- Attackers can force the application to send crafted requests to unexpected destinations
- Can bypass network access controls
- May lead to internal service exposure

**Example Attack Scenarios:**
- Accessing internal services behind firewalls
- Retrieving metadata from cloud services
- Port scanning internal networks
- Accessing local files

**Detection Methods:**
- Code review for URL validation
- Network monitoring
- Penetration testing

**Prevention Strategies:**
