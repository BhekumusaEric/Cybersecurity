    {
      "id": "q1",
      "question": "What is the primary goal of ethical hacking?",
      "options": [
        "To exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain",
        "To identify and fix security vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them",
        "To break into systems without permission",
        "To develop new hacking tools"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Ethical hacking aims to proactively identify and address security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors, thereby improving the overall security posture of an organization."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a phase in the ethical hacking methodology?",
      "options": [
        "Reconnaissance",
        "Scanning",
        "Exploitation",

    {
      "id": "q3",
      "question": "What is the difference between a white hat and a black hat hacker?",
      "options": [
        "White hat hackers are more skilled than black hat hackers",
        "White hat hackers operate with permission and follow legal and ethical guidelines, while black hat hackers operate maliciously and illegally",
        "White hat hackers only test web applications, while black hat hackers target networks",
        "White hat hackers work during the day, while black hat hackers work at night"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The key distinction is intent and permission. White hat hackers operate ethically with explicit permission to help improve security, while black hat hackers operate maliciously without permission for personal gain or to cause harm."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "question": "Which of the following documents provides written authorization for an ethical hacker to perform security testing?",

        "General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) is a U.S. federal law that prohibits unauthorized access to protected computers and networks, making it a critical legal consideration for ethical hackers."

        "Penetration Testing",
        "Compliance Audit"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Penetration testing goes beyond identifying vulnerabilities (as in a vulnerability assessment) by actively attempting to exploit them to demonstrate their real-world impact and the potential damage that could result."
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of the reconnaissance phase in ethical hacking?",
      "options": [
        "To exploit vulnerabilities in the target system",

        "To report findings to the client"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The reconnaissance phase focuses on gathering information about the target, often without direct interaction (passive reconnaissance), to map the attack surface and identify potential entry points for later phases."
    },
    {
      "id": "q8",
      "question": "Which of the following is an example of passive reconnaissance?",
      "options": [
        "Port scanning",
        "Social engineering",
        "Reviewing publicly available information about a company",
        "Vulnerability scanning"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target. Reviewing publicly available information (OSINT) is a classic example, while port scanning and vulnerability scanning involve active interaction."
    },

        "To remove vulnerabilities from the target system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The cleaning up process in post-exploitation aims to restore systems to their original state and remove any artifacts (like test files, accounts, or backdoors) created during testing to ensure the system is not left in a compromised state."
    },
    {
      "id": "q11",
      "question": "Which of the following best describes a 'grey hat' hacker?",
      "options": [
        "A hacker who works for government agencies",
        "A hacker who only targets grey-colored systems",
        "A hacker who may hack without explicit permission but typically doesn't have malicious intent",
        "A hacker who alternates between ethical and malicious hacking"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Grey hat hackers operate in a moral gray area - they may hack without explicit permission (unlike white hats) but typically don't have malicious intent (unlike black hats). They might, for example, disclose vulnerabilities to organizations after finding them without permission."
    },
    {
      "id": "q12",
      "question": "What is the main difference between a vulnerability assessment and a penetration test?",
      "options": [
        "Vulnerability assessments are automated, while penetration tests are manual",

        "Vulnerability assessments focus on networks, while penetration tests focus on applications"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The key difference is that vulnerability assessments focus on identifying and cataloging potential security weaknesses, while penetration tests go further by actively exploiting those vulnerabilities to demonstrate real-world impact."
    },
    {
      "id": "q13",
      "question": "What ethical principle is violated if an ethical hacker discovers sensitive data during testing and shares it with unauthorized parties?",
      "options": [
        "Respect for privacy",
        "Do no harm",
        "Maintain confidentiality",
        "All of the above"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "Sharing sensitive data with unauthorized parties violates multiple ethical principles: respect for privacy of the data subjects, the 'do no harm' principle by potentially causing damage to the organization, and the confidentiality obligation to the client."
    },
    {

        "To document and report findings"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The scanning phase involves actively probing the target systems to identify open ports, running services, and potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited in later phases."

        "A code review process for identifying security flaws in applications"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A red team assessment is a comprehensive simulation of a real-world attack that tests both technical security controls and human factors, often conducted over an extended period without the knowledge of the organization's defenders (blue team)."
    },
    {
      "id": "q18",
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of documenting the methodology in an ethical hacking report?",
      "options": [
        "To demonstrate the hacker's technical expertise",
        "To provide transparency and allow the client to understand and reproduce the findings",
        "To fulfill legal requirements",
        "To justify the cost of the assessment"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Documenting the methodology provides transparency and allows clients to understand how findings were discovered, validate the results, and potentially reproduce the tests in the future to verify that vulnerabilities have been properly remediated."
    },
    {
      "id": "q19",
      "question": "Which of the following is NOT a common categorization for penetration testing based on the level of information provided?",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The common categorizations are black box (no prior information), white box (full information), and grey box (limited information). 'Blue box testing' is not a standard term in penetration testing methodology."
    },
    {

        "Obtaining explicit written permission",
        "Setting up monitoring systems"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Obtaining explicit written permission is the most critical first step before beginning any ethical hacking engagement. Without proper authorization, the same activities could be considered illegal and result in civil or criminal penalties."
