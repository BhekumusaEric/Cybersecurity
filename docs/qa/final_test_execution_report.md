## Conclusion

The Ethical Hacking LMS application demonstrates strong overall quality with 92.1% of test cases passing. The application performs well on most devices and provides a good user experience for the core functionality. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed before submission to app stores.

The critical issues are concentrated in the lab environment functionality and offline synchronization, which are core features of the application. Fixing these issues should be prioritized to ensure a positive user experience upon release.

We recommend addressing the critical and high-priority issues identified in this report before proceeding with app store submission. The medium and low-priority issues can be addressed in subsequent updates as they do not significantly impact the core functionality of the application.

With these improvements, the Ethical Hacking LMS application will be well-positioned for a successful launch on both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.
