3. **SSH/Terminal Apps**: Connect to lab environments using mobile SSH clients

### Recommended Mobile Lab Setup

For the best experience with hands-on labs on mobile:

1. **Use a Tablet**: Larger screen provides better workspace
2. **External Keyboard**: Connect a Bluetooth keyboard for typing commands
3. **Landscape Orientation**: Rotate your device to landscape mode for more screen space
4. **Split-Screen**: On supported devices, use split-screen to view instructions and lab simultaneously

### Lab Limitations on Mobile

Some labs may have limited functionality on mobile devices:

- Complex network scanning tools
- Multiple-window workflows
- Resource-intensive applications

For these labs, consider using a desktop/laptop computer or a remote desktop solution.
