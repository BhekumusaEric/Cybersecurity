## üöÄ Deployment

### Option 1: Deploy to Render.com (Recommended for Free Tier)

1. Fork this repository to your GitHub account
2. Sign up for a [Render.com](https://render.com) account
3. In the Render dashboard, click "New" and select "Blueprint"
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Render will automatically detect the `render.yaml` file and set up the services
6. Click "Apply" to deploy the application

The deployment will create:
- A web service for the backend API
- A static site for the frontend
- Automatically connect the frontend to the backend

### Option 2: Manual Deployment to Render.com

#### Backend Deployment

1. In the Render dashboard, click "New" and select "Web Service"
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure the service:
   - **Name**: `ethical-hacking-lms-api`
   - **Environment**: Node
   - **Build Command**: `cd src/backend && npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `cd src/backend && node server.js`
   - **Plan**: Free

4. Add environment variables:
   - `NODE_ENV`: `production`
   - `PORT`: `10000`
   - `JWT_SECRET`: (generate a secure random string)
   - `JWT_EXPIRE`: `30d`
   - `DB_DIALECT`: `sqlite`

5. Click "Create Web Service"

#### Frontend Deployment

1. In the Render dashboard, click "New" and select "Static Site"
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Configure the service:
   - **Name**: `ethical-hacking-lms`
   - **Build Command**: `cd src/frontend && npm install && npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `src/frontend/dist`
   - **Plan**: Free

4. Add environment variable:
   - `VITE_API_URL`: (URL of your backend service + `/api`)

5. Click "Create Static Site"

### Option 3: Local Development with Docker

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.simple.yml up -d`
3. Access the application at:
